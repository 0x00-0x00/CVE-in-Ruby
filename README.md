# CVE-in-Ruby

It's a repository to import public exploits to be written in Ruby without Metasploit complication 

# Why not Metasploit? 
1. To educate poeple how to write exploits using Ruby 
2. To Write exploit for CVEs that doesn't have exploit in a *simple way*
3. To avoid Metasploit complications
4. To list a common exploit that we face in PT that may or may not exist in Metasploit
5. To Centeralize exploits that written in other languages to in Ruby

# How to contribute?

3. Create a sub-directory for your exploit with the same CVE number (`mkdir CVE-2016-xxxx`)
4. Create your `CVE-2016-xxx_exploit.rb` and `README.md` files. *Naming convsion is required*
5. Add the vulnerable application to the sub-directory `CVE-2016-xxxx`. ***Recommended!***

7. Push to the branch (`git push origin CVE-2016-xxxx`)
8. Cerate new Pull Request (PR)

# Notes
